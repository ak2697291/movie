I hope you're doing well! I came across your profile while exploring opportunities at Uber, and I noticed you're currently working there. I recently found an SDE 2 role that aligns closely with my background and experience (https://www.uber.com/global/en/careers/list/144354/?uclick_id=d78b7b4a-c572-418d-8d3d-74ed3b1919e2), and I wanted to ask if you'd be open to referring me.

If you're comfortable referring me, I'd really appreciate it. I’d be happy to share my resume and any other details you might need. Totally understand if you're not in a position to refer right now—just thought I’d reach out and ask.

Thanks so much, and hope everything’s going great on your end!
